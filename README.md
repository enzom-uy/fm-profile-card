### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
My name is Enzo MuÃ±oz, I'm a Front-end developer. I'm currently using Frontend Mentor to test and prove my skills, from the most basic to actual challenges for me. 
I'll be updating this repo while I'm working on it, along with providing live previews thanks to Github Pages ðŸ˜ƒ.

In this case I made a basic Profile Card Component, this time I decided to use Reactjs from scratch instead of HTMl and pure CSS, although it was still quite simple to make as it doesn't have much complexity behind it.
